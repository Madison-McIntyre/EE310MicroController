/* -------------------------
 *  Title: Interfacing with Sensors
 * -------------------------
 * Purpose:
 * This program takes the inputs from two touch-less switches as a code and acts
 * differently depending on if the code is correct. If the code is correct to
 * that of the SECRET_CODE, then the connected motor will be turned on. If the
 * code is not correct then a buzzer will play instead. the code also contains
 * an emergency switch which is enabled as an interrupt that buzzes the buzzer
 * to a specific melody to signify it has been enabled.
 * Dependencies: IOHeader.h, IO_innit.h, IOfunctions.h
 * Compiler: MPLAB X IDE v6.20: XC8 (v2.46)
 * Author: Madison McIntyre
 * Outputs: PORTD PORTB1, PORTB4, PORTB5, PORTB7, PORTC2
 * Inputs: PORTB2, PORTB3, PORTB6, PORTC3
 * Versions:
 *  V0.1: 04/20/24, start
 *  V0.2: 04/21/24, debug
 *  V1.0: 04/22/24, working version
